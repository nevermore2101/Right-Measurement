<h1>Introduction</h1>

The Right Measurement is a simple program I created during the 2nd semester of Computer Science course.

The main goal of this project was to use all the learnings of the semester; good practices of programming, OO concepts, String API, Exceptions, Collections, file handling and Unit testing).

<h1>About the Project</h1>

The Right Measurement is a simple Java Console application in which you can registers a person or yourself 
and from that you can calculate your BMI, body fat rate, check your ideal weight and check all yours and 
the other users registered data. When you select exit the application option, all the profiles are saved 
in a .ser file located at /Right Measurement folder, so that everytime you restart the application, the program reads 
this file and you have access to all the resgistered people again.
